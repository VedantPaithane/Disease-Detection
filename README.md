# Disease-Detection
Leaf disease detection system that uses CNN to calculate the amount of area in a leaf affected by a disease. Image segmentation and procressing are done prior to feeding the images to the model and it shows a remarkable accurracy for finding the disease area. This is then used to control a Micro-controller based spray for spraying pesticide based on level of infection.

Databases are available across the internet, the model has been trained for Rice diseases but with a few tweaks can be used for other plants as well.
